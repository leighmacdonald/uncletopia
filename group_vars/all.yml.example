  # 16: Always show admin names to root users.
  # --
  # Default: 13 (1+4+8)
  sm_show_activity: 31
  
  # Specifies whether menu sounds are enabled for menus created by SourceMod.
  # Menu sounds can be further configured in addons/sourcemod/configs/core.cfg.
  #
  #  Default: 1
  sm_menu_sounds: 1

  # Specifies how long of a delay, in seconds, should be used in between votes
  # that are "public" or can be spammed.  Whether or not this delay is obeyed
  # is dependent on the menu/command.
  # --
  # Default: 30
  sm_vote_delay: 30

  # Default datetime formatting rules when displaying to clients.
  # For full options, see: http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/strftime.html

  # Sets how SourceMod should check immunity levels when administrators target each other.
  # 0: Ignore immunity levels (except for specific group immunities).

  sm_time_adjustment: 0

  # Specifies the amount of time that is allowed between chat messages.  This

  # Specifies how the reserved slots plugin operates. Valid values are:
  # 0 : Public slots are used in preference to reserved slots. Reserved slots are freed before public slots.
  # 1 : If someone with reserve access joins into a reserved slot, the player with the highest latency and
  # no reserved slot access (spectator players are selected first) is kicked to make room. Thus, the reserved
  # slots always remains free. The only situation where the reserved slot(s) can become properly occupied is
  # if the server is full with reserve slot access clients.
  # 2 : The same as sm_reserve_type 1 except once a certain number of admins have been reached, the reserve slot
  # stops kicking people and anyone can join to fill the server. You can use this to simulate having a large
  # number of reserved slots with sm_reserve_type 0 but with only need to have 1 slot unavailable when there are
  # less admins connected.
