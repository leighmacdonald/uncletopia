// PLEASE KILL THE ROPE ENTITIES!! THERE ARE MAPS THAT WILL HAVE A LOT OF THESE.
// To know which entities to kill, just do sv_dump_edicts on the server console, and look for any high numbers on the left side.
// Usually it refers to entities that are not needed. Ask Dynamilk if it needs to be killed.
